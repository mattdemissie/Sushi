Cure the salmon with salt.
Put it in the freezer for 48+ hours.
Take out the salmon and let it warm up until room temerpature.
Take a good amount of sushi rice(normal rice and sushi rice are very different.)
Take the sushi rice and dump it in a large pot full of water.
Then start mixing the sushi rice into the water until the water is clear.
Then boil the water and the rice inside for about 20-30 minutes.
When it is done you let it cool.
When it finishes cooling you must sprinkle it with Sushi Rice Vinegar.
You want to make sure that when you scoop out the rice you want to make sure you dont have any rice sticking to the bottom of the pot.
You want to make sure you scoop your rice into a glass or wooden bowl.
You can sprinkle a little more Sushi Rice Vingar on to the rice.
You then want to take an avocado and cut into thin strips that are about 3 inches long, and 1 inch long.
You want to do this to the same as well but remember to cut the skin of the salmon off first.
You will need your sushi mat and you will need to put a sheet of Seaweed onto it.
Take your seaweed and spread the sushi rice onto the mat you, but make sure there is an inch left of the seaweed on the top which is not covered in sushi rice.
You then place the salmon and avocado next to the bottom edge of the mat horizantly and make sure the salmon and avocado are going from edge to edge.
You then are going to roll your sushi roll, from bottom to up.
When you roll the sushi you should roll it until it be a tube.
You then wet your knife with some water, so sushi rice doesnt stick to it.
You cut the edges sticking out from the roll.
You then cut them into six pieces.
You then put them on a plate.
You can now get the sauces and put them on the plate or the sushi.
You now have made yourself a salmon-avocado sushi roll.
